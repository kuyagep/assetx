## Clone

1. Open your terminal: You can use the command prompt on Windows, Terminal on macOS, or any Linux terminal.

2. Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository:

```bash
  cd /path/to/your/desired/directory
```
Replace /path/to/your/desired/directory with the actual path to the directory where you want to clone the repository.

3. Clone the repository using the following command:

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/kuyagep/assetx.git
```
This command will download the repository to your local machine.

4. Enter your GitHub credentials, if prompted.
Now you should have a local copy of the "assetx" repository on your computer.

## Installation

Once you have cloned the Laravel project from GitHub, you can follow these steps to install its dependencies using Composer:

1. Open your terminal and navigate to the root directory of the cloned Laravel project.

```bash
  cd assetx
```
2. Install Composer dependencies by running the following command:

```bash
  composer install
```
This command will read the composer.json file in your project, download all the required dependencies, and install them.

3. Create a copy of the environment configuration file. Laravel uses an .env file to manage environment-specific configurations. You should create one from the example file provided:
```bash
  cp .env.example .env
```

4. Generate an application key:
```bash
 php artisan key:generate
```
This will generate a unique application key for your project, which is used for encryption and security.
5. Configure the .env file. Open the .env file in a text editor and set your database connection details and other environment-specific configurations.

6. Create a database for your Laravel project in your database management system (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).

7. Run migrations to create the necessary database tables:
```bash
 php artisan migrate
```
8. Seed the database with initial data if your project includes database seeds:
```bash
 php artisan db:seed
```
9. Finally, you can start the Laravel development server:
```bash
 php artisan serve
```

This will start the development server, and you can access your Laravel application by opening a web browser and navigating to the address displayed in your terminal (usually http://localhost:8000).
